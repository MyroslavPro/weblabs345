# CRUD Javascript App: View Page

You have to make a simple presentation part of a website

For your blocks you must use data from your java/python project class.

Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations): 
●	Sort of your items option
●	Search option 
●	Count total amount of some of the field 
(e.g total price of all cars)

Requirements:
●	Responsiveness absolutely not required.
●	Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

# 4. CRUD Javascript App: Create/Edit Pages

Description: In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages (You can find the template of these pages by following the link)

Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).
If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.

Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.

Requirements:
●	Responsiveness absolutely not required.
●	Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.
